# WallPlottE
A Polargraph / drawbot platform for fun

started at https://wiki.themakerstation.com/Main_Page

inspired by http://www.polargraph.co.uk/ and similar projects

so far all materials are under $100 besides 3d printed parts.

# Goals

1. Create a moular platform for collaborating onn and advancing drawbots
2. Keep parts as simple, available and cheap as possible, keep the bar for entry low
3. Allow for multiple tools
4. On board computer control
5. Battery power optional
6. Fast and easy setup

# Current approach

- Raspberry pi zero
- Servo hat for raspberry pi zero: https://www.adafruit.com/product/3416
- 2 continuos rotation servos
- 3mm ball chain: 100 feet / 30 meters
- nylon load bearing balls to reduce dragging across surface: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07BM1XRZQ/
- Python control through web interface

We are attempting to put the motors in the gondula and allow for it to hold multiple tools and rotate them in place

The platform is a disc 200m in diameter with some standard holes around it, and a cutout in the middle for tools. This will hopefully allow for modular development of different parts and configurations at once.
